TYPES OF MODELS:

1.	STATISTICAL MODELS

Linear Regression – 
•	Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm used for regression.
•	Works well with linearly related data.
•	Predicts Continuous values.
•	Uses Straight line 
•	Sensitive to outliers.
•	Not suitable for non linear relationship.
•	In this we predict dependent variables(target) from independent variables(Input variable)
•	Regression line y=b0+b1x
 		 B0-Intercept
B1- slope
Evaluation – MSE (Mean Squared Error)
                           MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
                            R2(Coefficient of Determination)
Example-House Price Prediction

Logistic Regression – 
•	Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm used for classification not regression.
•	Predicts Categorical values(dependent variable).
•	Uses Sigmoid Curve.
•	Sigmoid Function – Converts value between 0 and 1
•	If probability>0.5(threshold)=Predict class 1
•	If probability<0.5(threshold)=Predict class 2
•	Evaluation metrics 
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1- Score, ROC curve & Area under Curve
•	Sensitive to outlier

2. MACHINE LEARNING MODELS

Decision Trees
•	Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm used for classification and Regression.
•	Splits data into branches based on certain conditions, ending in decisions(leaves).
•	Root Node(First split)
•	Decision Node(Intermediate Splits based on condition)
•	Leaf Node(Final Outcomes)
•	Splits are made to group data together.
•	Process continues until stopping criteria is met.
•	Can easily overfit.
•	EXAMPLE- LOAN APPROVAL SYSTEM.

Random Forests 
•	Ensemble Learning method, Combine many decision trees to make better predictions.
•	Used for both classification and regression.
•	Create multiple decision trees using random subsets of training data.
•	At each split in a tree, only a random subsets of features is considered.
•	For Classification – Each tree votes for a class, majority wins
•	For Regression- Predictions are averaged.
•	Robust to noise and missing values.
•	Needs tuning(no of trees, depth) 
EXAMPLE- Predicting if a customer will buy a product or not

SVM(Support Vector Machine)
•	Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm.
•	Used for both Classification and Regression.
•	Finds best separating boundary Hyperplane.
•	Data point closest to boundary most important because they define the margin.
•	Kernel- Separates non linearly separated data into linearly separated by projecting into higher dimensions.
•	Common Kernel- Linear, Polynomial, RBF, Sigmoid
•	For non linear data it uses Kernels 
•	EXAMPLE- EMAIL SPAM DETECTION
