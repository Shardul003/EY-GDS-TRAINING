AZURE QUEUE STORAGE:----

1. Azure Storage includes a straightforward and reasonably priced message queuing service. 
2. It sends and receives messages using the HTTP/HTTPS protocols.
3. It operates on a best-effort FIFO basis and does not guarantee strict message ordering.
4. There is no integrated support for transactions or duplicate detection. 
5. 64 KB is the maximum message size. allows for at least one delivery, which implies that a message may be handled more than once.
6. It does not have built-in dead-letter queues; manual error handling is required. 
7. It lacks sophisticated routing and pub/sub models and only provides basic queueing features.
8. It is less expensive and ideal for straightforward, decoupled communication between application elements.
9. It is frequently utilised for lightweight message passing, task queues, and background job processing.

AZURE SERVICE BUS:---
1. An enterprise-grade messaging platform built for complex and large-scale communication scenarios.
2. Primarily uses the AMQP protocol, but also supports HTTP for compatibility.
3. Supports FIFO message delivery through sessions and message sequencing.
4. Includes duplicate detection and transaction support for high reliability.
5. Message size limits: up to 256 KB (Standard tier) and 1 MB (Premium tier).
6. Offers at-least-once and exactly-once delivery guarantees, depending on configuration.
7. Provides built-in dead-letter queues (DLQs) for handling undeliverable or failed messages.
8. Supports advanced messaging features such as topics, subscriptions, message scheduling, and auto-forwarding.
9. More feature-rich but costlier compared to Azure Queue Storage.
Ideal for enterprise applications, financial systems, and microservice architectures requiring reliability and message control.
