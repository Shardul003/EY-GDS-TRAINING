A data pipeline is a set of connected processes that collect, transform, and deliver data from multiple sources to a destination system for analysis or storage.

Main Stages of a Data Pipeline

1. Data Ingestion
Collecting raw data from different sources such as:
Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
APIs (Twitter API, Weather API)
Files (CSV, JSON, Excel)
Sensors, IoT devices, or logs

2.Data Processing / Transformation
Cleaning, filtering, aggregating, and transforming the data into a usable format.
Includes removing duplicates, handling missing values, and converting formats.
Techniques:
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

3. Data Storage
Processed data is stored for future analysis.
Could be a data warehouse, data lake, or database.
Examples: Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, Snowflake, Hadoop HDFS

4. Data Consumption
The final step where data is used for:
Business Intelligence (BI) dashboards (Power BI, Tableau)
Machine Learning models
Reports or APIs

Types of Data Pipelines
1. Batch Pipeline	Processes data in chunks or batches (e.g., every hour or day).	Daily sales reports, payroll data
2. Streaming Pipeline	Processes data in real-time as it arrives.	Stock prices, IoT sensor data
3. Hybrid Pipeline	Combines batch and streaming processes.	Real-time alerts + historical trend analysis
Example Flow

E-commerce Data Pipeline:

1. Data Sources → Website, Mobile App, Payment Gateway
2. Ingestion → Collected using Kafka
3. Processing → Cleaned & aggregated in Spark
4. Storage → Loaded into Snowflake data warehouse
5. Consumption → Visualized in Power BI dashboards
Use Cases of Data Pipelines

1. Real-time fraud detection – Streaming pipeline for banks.
2. Customer analytics – Combine app, web, and CRM data into a single warehouse.
3. Predictive maintenance – IoT sensors send continuous data for real-time analysis.
4. Social media monitoring – Stream tweets or posts to detect trends.
5. Data lake creation – Collect and store all raw enterprise data for future ML/AI use.
