A data pipeline is a set of connected processes that collect, transform, and deliver data from multiple sources to a destination system for analysis or storage.

Main Stages of a Data Pipeline

1. Data Ingestion
Collecting raw data from different sources such as:
Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
APIs (Twitter API, Weather API)
Files (CSV, JSON, Excel)
Sensors, IoT devices, or logs

2.Data Processing / Transformation
Cleaning, filtering, aggregating, and transforming the data into a usable format.
Includes removing duplicates, handling missing values, and converting formats.
Techniques:
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

3. Data Storage
Processed data is stored for future analysis.
Could be a data warehouse, data lake, or database.
Examples: Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, Snowflake, Hadoop HDFS

4. Data Consumption
The final step where data is used for:
Business Intelligence (BI) dashboards (Power BI, Tableau)
Machine Learning models
Reports or APIs

Types of Data Pipelines
1. Batch Pipeline	Processes data in chunks or batches (e.g., every hour or day).	Daily sales reports, payroll data
2. Streaming Pipeline	Processes data in real-time as it arrives.	Stock prices, IoT sensor data
3. Hybrid Pipeline	Combines batch and streaming processes.	Real-time alerts + historical trend analysis
Example Flow

E-commerce Data Pipeline:

1. Data Sources → Website, Mobile App, Payment Gateway
2. Ingestion → Collected using Kafka
3. Processing → Cleaned & aggregated in Spark
4. Storage → Loaded into Snowflake data warehouse
5. Consumption → Visualized in Power BI dashboards
Use Cases of Data Pipelines

1. Real-time fraud detection – Streaming pipeline for banks.
2. Customer analytics – Combine app, web, and CRM data into a single warehouse.
3. Predictive maintenance – IoT sensors send continuous data for real-time analysis.
4. Social media monitoring – Stream tweets or posts to detect trends.
5. Data lake creation – Collect and store all raw enterprise data for future ML/AI use.


ETL stands for Extract → Transform → Load. It’s a classic data-integration pattern used to move data from source systems into a target system (usually a data warehouse or data mart) after cleaning and transforming it so it’s ready for analysis.
1) High-level flow
1. Extract — read data from source systems (databases, APIs, files, logs, IoT, etc.).
2. Transform — clean, validate, enrich, convert types, join, aggregate, and apply business rules.
3. Load — write the transformed data into the target (data warehouse, data lake, OLAP store).


2) Extract — details
Goal: get raw data out of sources reliably and with minimal impact.
Source types: OLTP DBs (MySQL, Postgres), APIs, S3/Blob, CSV/Excel, message queues (Kafka), logs, SaaS (Salesforce), sensors.
Methods:
Full export: dump entire table/file (simple, heavy).
Incremental / CDC (Change Data Capture): capture only changed rows (recommended for production). Tools: Debezium, native DB replication, or WAL-based readers.
API pagination / offsets / webhooks: for SaaS sources.
Considerations: authentication, rate limits, network latency, schema drift, consistent snapshots (transactions), and impact on source performance.

3) Transform — details (the core)
Goal: convert raw data into clean, consistent, analytics-ready data.
Types of transformations
Data cleaning: remove duplicates, fix malformed records, normalize text/case.
Type conversions: strings → dates, decimals, integers.
Data enrichment: map codes to labels, lookup reference data, geocoding, add business attributes.
Normalization / denormalization: split/join tables as needed.
Filtering / validation: drop invalid rows or route them to a dead-letter queue.
Aggregation: daily summaries, rollups, windowing functions.
Business logic: revenue calculations, churn flags, segment assignment.
Anonymization / masking: remove PII for privacy/compliance.
Complex transformations: heavy joins, sessionization, event-time windows for streaming.

Where transformation happens
ETL (classic): transformations happen before load (in an ETL engine or staging area).
ELT: load raw data first, then transform inside the data warehouse (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery) using SQL — useful when warehouses are cheap/powerful.

4) Load
Goal: persist transformed data into the destination in the correct schema and with correct integrity.
Target types: data warehouse (Redshift, Snowflake, BigQuery), data lake (S3/HDFS), analytical DBs, OLAP cubes.
Patterns:
Upsert (merge): insert new rows + update existing (MERGE statement).
Append-only: write new snapshots or event logs.
Overwrite partitions: replace partitioned slices (e.g., daily partitions).
Performance concerns: batch sizes, parallelism, write throughput, transactional consistency.
Idempotency: jobs should be safe to retry without duplicating data. Use dedup keys/timestamps.


5) ETL vs ELT — when to use each
ETL (transform before load) — 
Target system is not powerful for heavy transformations.
You must deliver clean, curated tables to downstream teams.
Data must be transformed for compliance or to remove PII before entering target.

ELT (load then transform in warehouse) — good when:
You have a powerful data warehouse (Snowflake, BigQuery) so pushing transformations there is cheaper/faster.
You want to keep raw data for reprocessing or reproducibility.
You prefer SQL-based transformations and analytics-friendly tooling.
