Task:         “Build & Judge a Mini AI”
Part 1 — Chronology of AI
Write one real-world example for each stage:
Machine Learning →
Deep Learning →
Computer Vision →
NLP →
LLMs →

Part 2 — Deep Learning Architectures
Match the model to the use case:
1. RNN
2. LSTM
3. CNN
4. Transformer
Use cases:
Image recognition
Text translation (old Google Translate)
Predicting the next word in ChatGPT
Early speech-to-text systems

Part 3 — Frameworks
Choose one framework (PyTorch / TensorFlow / Keras).
In one sentence, explain why you would use it if you were a student making a
cat-vs-dog classifier.
Part 4 — Evaluation Metrics
Imagine you built a spam filter. Answer:
Precision: If it marks 10 emails as spam and 7 are truly spam → what’s
Precision?
Recall: If there were 12 spam emails in total, how many did it catch?
(use same example)
F1 Score: Use the formula and calculate (round to 2 decimals).
MSE/MAE: Predict your friend’s age (actual = 15, prediction = 18). Which
metric punishes the error more?
BLEU/ROUGE: AI translated “The cat sat on the mat” as “Cat is on the
mat.” Which metric (BLEU/ROUGE) do you think would give a high score?

Part 5 — Responsible AI & Explainability
You built an AI that predicts loan approvals.
A customer asks, “Why was my loan rejected?”

Write one simple way to explain the decision fairly (e.g., “Your income was too
low compared to the loan size”).
