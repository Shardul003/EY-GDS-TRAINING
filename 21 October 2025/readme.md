What is Prompting?
The process of providing a large language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, with an input (prompt) in order to produce a desired output is known as prompting.
Consider the prompt as the question or instruction that lets the model know what you want.
The precision and applicability of the model's response are directly impacted by the prompt's quality, clarity, and organization.

For instance:
The prompt is to "write a formal email requesting a project deadline extension."
After interpreting this, the model generates a formal email.
To put it simply:
Prompting = Using carefully worded instructions to communicate with the model.

Types of Prompting :
Depending on your objective and the task's complexity, there are various approaches to creating prompts.
 The primary prompting technique types utilized in AI and NLP are listed below:

 1. Prompting with zero-shot
 Definition: The model is given instructions and is asked to complete a task without any examples.
 For instance:
 "Convert this statement into French: I enjoy picking up new languages."
 To react appropriately, the model uses its internal knowledge.
 Use Case: When the task is straightforward or well-known and you want prompt answers.

 2. Single-Shot Prompting
 Definition: To help the model, you give one example of the task. For instance:  Spanish: Hola → English: Hello
 Translate now:  Good morning in English → Spanish:
 This aids the model in comprehending the format or pattern you anticipate.

3. Few-Shot Prompting
Definition:
You give a few examples (2–5) before asking for the actual output.
Example:
“English: Thank you → French: Merci
English: Goodbye → French: Au revoir
English: Please → French:”
This improves accuracy for structured tasks like translation, classification, or code generation.

4. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting
Definition:
You explicitly ask the model to show its reasoning steps before answering.
Example:
“Explain your reasoning step by step:
What is 18 × 12?”
The model first explains its thinking process (“18 × 10 = 180, 18 × 2 = 36, total = 216”) before giving the final answer.
Benefit: Improves reasoning, arithmetic, and logical tasks.

5. Instruction Prompting
Definition:
The model is trained or fine-tuned to follow explicit natural-language instructions (e.g., “Summarize this paragraph”).
This is the basis of models like ChatGPT and InstructGPT.

6. Contextual Prompting
Definition:
You give the model contextual information before asking your question.
This helps it respond based on background data.
Example:
“Given that Brillio is a technology company focused on digital transformation, write a short company overview.”

7. Multimodal Prompting
Definition:
You provide prompts that include more than one type of input, such as text + image, text + audio, etc.
Example:
Upload an image of a chart and ask: “Summarize the trend shown in this chart.”

What Is Prompt Tuning?
For large language models, prompt tuning is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method.
 Prompt tuning learns and optimizes a small set of extra parameters, referred to as "soft prompts," that direct the model toward a particular task rather than retraining the entire model, which is computationally costly.
 The Simpler Way Prompt Tuning Operates:
1. Start with a Pretrained Model: Large amounts of text data have already been used to train the base LLM (such as GPT, T5, or BERT).
2. Add Learnable Prompts (Soft Prompts): These are tiny "virtual tokens" (soft prompts) that are added to the input embeddings in place of changing the main model weights.
3. During tuning, the model learns these tokens, which are numerical vectors rather than real words.
4. Once trained, the soft prompt can be prepended to any input to make the model behave optimally for that task.

Example of Prompt Tuning :
Suppose you want a model to perform sentiment analysis efficiently.
Instead of fine-tuning the entire GPT model on labeled sentiment data,
You add learnable prompt embeddings before each sentence (e.g., “Review sentiment: [soft prompt tokens] The product is amazing”),
Train only those soft tokens to adjust model behavior for sentiment classification.
This way, you achieve task specialization without modifying the full model.

Advantages of Prompt Tuning
Advantage	Explanation
1. Efficiency	Only a small number of parameters (soft prompts) are trained, reducing computational and storage costs.
2. Reusability	A single base model can support multiple tasks — each with its own tuned prompt — without retraining the full model.
3. Faster Adaptation	Training takes less time since only prompt vectors are optimized.
4. Lower Cost	Avoids the need for expensive GPU resources and massive datasets for fine-tuning.
5. Maintain Model Integrity	The base model remains unchanged, preserving its general language ability.
6. Easy Deployment	You can quickly switch between tasks by loading different prompt embeddings.
7. Environmentally Friendly	Reduced training requirements mean lower energy consumption — more sustainable AI development.
