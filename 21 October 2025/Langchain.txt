LangChain is a powerful framework designed to help developers build applications that integrate language models with external data sources, tools, and workflows. It's especially useful for creating AI agents, chatbots, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, and autonomous decision-making tools.
We can build with LangChain:
- Chatbots that use custom data (PDFs, websites, databases)
- AI agents that can use tools like calculators, search engines, or APIs
- RAG systems that combine LLMs with search or vector databases
- Workflow automation using chains of reasoning and decision-making
- Custom prompt engineering and memory management

 Example Use Case
Hereâ€™s a simple example: a chatbot that answers questions based on a PDF.
- Load the PDF using langchain.document_loaders.
- Split it into chunks with langchain.text_splitter.
- Embed chunks using langchain.embeddings.
- Store them in a vector database like FAISS or Chroma.
- Use a RetrievalQA chain to answer questions using the stored chunks.
