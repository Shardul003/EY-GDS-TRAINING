RabbitMQ acts like a middleman between systems or services.
It receives messages from one application (the producer) and delivers them to another (the consumer).
Decouples systems (no direct dependency between services)

Scales easily (many producers/consumers can connect)

Reliable (ensures message delivery with acknowledgments and retries)

Supports multiple protocols (like AMQP, MQTT, STOMP)
Producer	Sends messages to RabbitMQ
Queue	Stores messages until they are processed
Consumer	Receives and processes messages
Exchange	Routes messages to appropriate queues based on rules
Binding	Defines the connection between an exchange and a queue
software that helps different parts of a system communicate with each other asynchronously (without waiting for an immediate response).
