RabbitMQ acts like a middleman between systems or services.
It receives messages from one application (the producer) and delivers them to another (the consumer).
Decouples systems (no direct dependency between services)

Scales easily (many producers/consumers can connect)

Reliable (ensures message delivery with acknowledgments and retries)

Supports multiple protocols (like AMQP, MQTT, STOMP)
Producer	Sends messages to RabbitMQ
Queue	Stores messages until they are processed
Consumer	Receives and processes messages
Exchange	Routes messages to appropriate queues based on rules
Binding	Defines the connection between an exchange and a queue
software that helps different parts of a system communicate with each other asynchronously (without waiting for an immediate response).


Why Use a Queue in Real time systems
Consumers (like analytics processors, databases, or dashboards) might not process data at the same rate.
A queue allows each side to work independently.
If one goes down, the other still works.


Example:
A traffic monitoring system collects vehicle speed data (producer) and updates the dashboard (consumer).
If the dashboard slows down, the queue ensures data isn’t lost.

Load Balancing

Queues distribute tasks evenly among multiple consumers.
Helps prevent any single consumer from getting overloaded.


Example:
In a ride-hailing app, trip requests go into a queue, and multiple dispatch servers read from it simultaneously.

Fault Tolerance & Reliability

If a consumer crashes, the queue can retain unprocessed messages until it comes back online.
Ensures no data loss and guaranteed message delivery.


Rate Control (Buffering)

In real-time systems, data can arrive faster than it’s processed.
A queue smooths out the spikes in traffic, preventing overloads.


Example:
A video streaming app collects user activity logs — a queue buffers those logs before writing to a database.
