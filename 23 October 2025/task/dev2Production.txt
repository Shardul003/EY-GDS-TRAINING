1. Development Environment (Dev)
Purpose:  Used by developers to write, test, and debug code during the initial stages of software creation.
Users:  Developers and engineers.
Characteristics: Frequent code changes and feature implementations.
Debugging tools and logs enabled.
May use mock or minimal data.
Unstable—focus is on functionality, not reliability.
Example:  A developer tests new login API logic on their local machine or in a shared dev server.

2. QA Environment (Quality Assurance)
Purpose:  Dedicated for testing by the QA team to validate functionality, performance, and bug fixes.
Users:  QA testers and automation engineers.
Characteristics:  Code from the Dev environment is deployed here for testing.
Automated and manual test cases are executed.
Test data is used (not real production data).
Focus is on finding defects early.
Example:  QA verifies that new user registration works correctly and reports any bugs to developers.

3. Staging Environment
Purpose:  A near-identical copy of the production environment for final testing before release.
Users:  Developers, QA, and DevOps teams.
Characteristics:  Mirrors production configurations closely (servers, database, integrations).
Used for final integration, regression, and performance testing.
Acts as the last safety net before deployment to production.
Example:  The entire app version is deployed here to ensure that deployments and APIs behave as expected under real conditions.

4. UAT (User Acceptance Testing)
Purpose:  Allows end-users or clients to verify if the system meets their business requirements.
Users:  Business analysts, clients, or selected end-users.
Characteristics:  Testing based on real-world business scenarios.
Confirms readiness for production.
Only minimal bug fixes should occur here.
Usually managed by the QA or release team.
Example:  The client tests the new “report generation” feature to confirm it meets agreed specifications.

5. PPE (Pre-Production Environment)
Purpose:  A final rehearsal before going live — often used to test deployment scripts, data migrations, and integrations.
Users:  DevOps, release managers, and sometimes key business stakeholders.
Characteristics:  Exact replica of production (hardware, software, and configurations).
Validates deployment and rollback procedures.
Monitors performance under realistic load conditions.
Example:  Run a simulated production deployment and check all system components before the actual release.

6. Production Environment
Purpose:  The live environment where end-users access the actual application.
Users:  Real customers or users.
Characteristics:  Highly stable, secure, and monitored continuously.
Only tested, approved code is deployed here.
Real data is used.
Changes are made through controlled CI/CD releases.
Example:  The app version that users download or access online (e.g., Paytm’s live mobile app).

⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline Overview
CI (Continuous Integration)
Developers frequently commit code to a shared repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
Automated build tools (like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) compile and integrate code.
Unit tests and static code analysis ensure new changes don’t break existing functionality.
Fast feedback loop — developers are alerted of issues early.
  
CD (Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment)
Continuous Delivery:
Code is automatically built, tested, and prepared for deployment to staging/UAT.
Deployment to production still requires manual approval.
Continuous Deployment:
Every code change that passes automated tests is automatically deployed to production.

No manual intervention needed.
