SQL- 
•	Structured Query Language
•	High level Language 
•	They are Relational Databases where data is stored in structured tables (rows and columns).
•	They have fixed Schema.
•	Strong ACID Support.
•	Best for structured data.
Example- MySQL, PostgreSQL

NoSQL
•	Not Only SQL databases
•	They are non relational databases used to store unstructured and semistructured , or rapidly changing data.
•	They have flexible schema.
•	Each NoSQL Database has its own way (not standard SQL)
•	Used for big/varied data.
Example- MongoDB(document-based), Cassandra(column based)

What are Scenario in which I need to choose one over other?

When to choose SQL
1.Strong Consistency Required.
•	Banking System, Inventory Management
2.Structured data with fixed Schema 
•	Employee records, Student Databases
3. Complex queries and relationships
•	Reporting dashboards using joins.
•	Airline Reservation system
4. Transactional Systems (ACID properties needed )
•	ATM Withdrawals

When to choose NoSQL
1.	Handling large scale or big data 
•	Social media apps 
•	Iot devices generating continuous sensor data
2.	Unstructured or semistructured data 
•	Json logs, chat messages
3.	High Scalability and Performance
•	Ecommerce, Gaming Leaderboards(real time updates)
4.	Graph Relationships
•	Recommendation engines

Advantages of SQL and NoSQL

SQL
1.	Structured and organized
2.	Strong consistency( ACID Properties)
3.	Standardized Query Language
4.	Data Relationship
5.	Security and Access Control
NoSQL
1.	High Scalability
2.	Less Schema 
3.	Faster performance for big data
4.	Variety of data models 
5.	Cost effectiveness for scale
