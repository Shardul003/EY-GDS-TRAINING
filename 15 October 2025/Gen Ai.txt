Generative AI can be defined as machine learning models, particularly Generative Models, which apply algorithms (e.g., transformers, GANs, VAEs) to generate novel outputs like essays, music, images, or software code.
How It Works:
1. The model is trained on large corpora (text, images, audio, etc)

2. It learns the patterns, structures, and relationships in that data.

3. It then generates new content that is following the same patterns ‚Äî but not a copy.

Main Types of Generative AI:

Type	Description	Examples / Tools

1. Text Generation	Creates written content like essays, summaries, scripts, or code comments.	ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Claude, Copy.ai
2. Image Generation	Produces realistic or artistic images from text prompts.	DALL¬∑E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion.
3. Audio Generation	Generates music, speech, or sound effects.	OpenAI Jukebox, ElevenLabs, MusicLM
4. Code Generation	Writes and debugs computer code automatically.	GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT (code mode), Amazon CodeWhisperer
5. Video Generation (Bonus)	Creates video clips or animations from text or images.	Runway ML, Pika Labs, Synthesia.

Applications:

Content creation: Blogs, stories, and marketing material

Design & art: AI-generated artwork and branding

Software development: Auto-completing or writing code

Education: Summarizing notes or explaining topics




üß© Major Model Architectures Behind Generative AI

Model Type	Full Form	Used In	How It Works

1. Transformer	‚Äî	Text, Code, Audio	Uses ‚Äúattention mechanism‚Äù to understand relationships between tokens (words, symbols). Powers GPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.
2. GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)	‚Äî	Image, Video	Has two neural networks (Generator & Discriminator) that compete ‚Äî one creates images, the other judges them.
3. VAE (Variational Autoencoder)	‚Äî	Image, Audio	Compresses input data into a ‚Äúlatent space‚Äù and reconstructs new samples from it. Good for smooth variation generation.
4. Diffusion Model	‚Äî	Image, Video, Audio	Gradually adds noise to data, then learns to reverse the noise ‚Äî generating realistic outputs. Used in DALL¬∑E 3 and Stable Diffusion

Key Advantages

Saves time in creative and repetitive tasks

Boosts innovation in content creation

Makes AI accessible to non-technical users

Enables new industries like ‚Äúprompt engineering‚Äù
